# Not found

> _“If you search for it, you’ll find everything.” &mdash;&nbsp;Short&nbsp;Thoughts, Nichijou_

Unfortunately, life isn’t that easy. Sometimes I still have to ask my mom to look for things for me after I couldn’t find them. Sometimes you can’t look for things, they have to come to you.

<!-- For example, you can’t chase happiness, it’ll just make you sad and you being not happy will make you more sad. However, if you be patient and do something else (like read a book idk), happiness will arrive when you least expect it. -->

For example, you can’t chase butterflies, they’ll just run away from you. But if instead you be patient and read a book or something, when you least expect it a butterfly might land or your elbow or on the bridge of your nose. That’s something that’ll make anyone’s day.

Perhaps you’ve landed on this page 15 times already. If so, I recommend you take a break. Go get some coffee. <noscript class="inline">And while you’re at it, enable JavaScript as well. Kudos to you for finding this easter egg.</noscript>

Perhaps you’re done with your break.

Perhaps you just can’t find it. If so, I’m sorry to hear that. Send me an email and tell me how you got here.

Perhaps you purposefully typed in a non-existent URL just to find this letter. Perhaps you didn’t read it.

Since this is a dead link, here’s a dead Link.
